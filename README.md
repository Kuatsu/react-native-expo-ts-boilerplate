* Expo, Expo EAS and `expo-dev-client` for easy development and deployment + using previously unsupported native modules with Expo 🚀
* State management using the lightweight & unopinionated library zustand. 🐻
* Simple [@react-navigation/native](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) Stack set-up 🗺
* Custom `Text` component for easily adding custom font families with different font weights into your project, either from local fonts or Google Fonts using @expo-google-fonts! 📝
* Localizations using expo-localization and i18n-js 🌍
* Linting and preconfigured style guides using ESLint and great plugins like airbnb and react-hooks ✅
* Husky hook to lint commit messages using conventional-commit rules 🥸
* Completely open-source using the MIT license! ✨
